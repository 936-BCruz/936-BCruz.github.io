<h1>About Me</h1>
<p >I am an undergraduate physics student from the University of Puerto Rico at Mayag√ºez <a href="https://www.uprm.edu/portada/">(UPRM)</a>
and a CMS Experiment Collaborator, supervised by Dr. <a href="http://charma.uprm.edu/~malik/">Sudir Malik</a>.</p>
 
<p >Spring 2021 <a href="https://iris-hep.org/fellows">IRIS-HEP Fellow</a>. 
 
I worked on the "Translating analyses into prototype analysis systems" project, mentored by <a href="https://github.com/jpivarski">Dr. Jim Pivarski</a>.
I translated the CMS Open Data Higgs to 4 leptons analysis from its original ROOT code toa python code with COFFEA and Awkward-array tools.

      <p >Learned to scout CMS open data and perform analysis on them using software tools such as a Docker image of a CMSSW.</p>
 <li>Github CI/CD workshop</li>
      <p >Learned to use Github Actions to automatically build and test codebases.</p>
</ul>
